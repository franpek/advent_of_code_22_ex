# AdventOfCode22

**Description**

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

In 2022, by doing it daily I reached day 6, completing both problems presented for each day, scoring 12 stars.
